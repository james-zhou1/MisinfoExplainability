As such, he would not have had the authority to directly insert anything into any state budget. \n\nReason 2: The role of U.S. Congress is to create federal legislation, not state legislation. Any money allocated to states is typically done so in accordance with existing federal laws and regulations. \n\nReason 3: Though Congress can allocate money to states in the form of grants, it highly unlikely that Senator Rubio was in any way instrumental in allocating $1.5 million to a single rowing institute. Federal funds often follow a long, bureaucratic process designed to ensure fiscal responsibility and compliance with the various federal laws and regulations. Additionally, any request for such a large amount of money would likely have drawn significant scrutiny from those tasked with deliberating the proposal. This difficulty is further compounded considering the specific topic of the requested funds, a rowing institute. Thus it is highly unlikely that Marco Rubio was able to insert $1.5 million for a rowing institute into the state budget, making pants-fire the most appropriate classification."

It would be unlikely that such an expensive initiative would be proposed and accepted in a single budgeting cycle.\n\nReason 3: In general, government facilities, such as funding for schools, roads, and public parks, are typically of greater benefit to a wider population than a single rowing institute. As such, it would have been expected that Rubio would have proposed a measure that would benefit the public more generally. \n\nReason 4: Using the state budget to fund a project that benefits few people takes away valuable resources that could have been used to better the state as a whole. This is especially the case in a time of budget cuts and other cost saving measures, which could lead to the state slipping further into debt, rather than getting itself out of it.\n\nReason 5: The opportunity cost of establishing one rowing institute in the state would be incredibly high. The money spent on the institute could have been instead used towards projects such as improved healthcare and education. This suggests that"

It is undisputable that the Speaker of the House cannot insert funding for a specific program into the state budget. It is the job of the Legislature to vote on the budget. Another reason this statement is Pants-fire is that Marco Rubio never proposed a budget amendment for the rowing institute. A budget amendment is a proposed alteration to the existing budget that is voted on by the Legislature. A search of the official record of the Florida House of Representatives for a budget amendment to fund the rowing institute did not yield any results. Finally, the statement neglects to mention that the rowing institute funding was actually proposed by State Senator Don Gaetz. In 2007, Gaetz proposed a bill that called for $1.5 million in funding to construct and establish the rowing institute while Rubio was Speaker of the House. This bill was ultimately passed by the Legislature and signed into law. Therefore, according to the facts, this statement is Pants-fire."
