While it is true that the number of people employed in the United States has generally decreased since peaking in 1979, the large decrease does not correspond to an overall decrease in employment. In fact, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that the size of the civilian labor force has grown by over 49 million since 1979 and that there are still more than 155 million U.S. citizens toiling away in some form of employment.\n\nThe reason employment levels have dropped over the past forty years is mainly due to the decline of manufacturing jobs. While the manufacturing industry still employs millions of people, its contribution to overall U.S. employment levels has been drastically reduced since the '70s. At the same time, the BLS reports that the broadening of job opportunities in categories such as healthcare, hospitality, business services, and education have grown to employ more Americans, thus compensating for the decrease in manufacturing jobs. \n\nTo summarize, while it is true that fewer people are employed now than in the '70s, what that statement fails to take into account is the vast array of new employment opportunities created in the decades since the 1970s.",
